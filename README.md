# GraphQL in Python

A simple GraphQL API implementation using Graphene in Python for managing a book collection.

## Description

This project demonstrates a basic GraphQL API that provides queries for retrieving book information. It includes functionality to fetch all books and search for specific books by title.

## Features

- GraphQL Schema with Book type definition
- Query support for retrieving all books
- Query support for finding books by title
- Sample data with classic literature books

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Graphene library

## ðŸ›  Installation

1. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install graphene
```

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

## ðŸš€Usage

Run the script:
```bash
python books.py
```

### Example Queries

Fetch all books:
```graphql
{
    allBooks {
        title
        author
    }
}
```

        title
        author
    }
}
```

    author: String
}
```
